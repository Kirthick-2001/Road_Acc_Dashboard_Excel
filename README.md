# Road Accident Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing road accident data to identify trends and insights that can help improve road safety. The data includes various details about each accident, such as location, date, severity, and weather conditions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Initial cleaning of raw data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis to identify key factors contributing to accidents.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and charts to visually represent the findings.

## Data
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Accident_Index`: Unique identifier for each accident.
- `Accident Date`: Date of the accident.
- `Day_of_Week`: Day of the week the accident occurred.
- `Junction_Control`: Type of junction control present at the accident location.
- `Junction_Detail`: Detailed description of the junction.
- `Accident_Severity`: Severity of the accident (e.g., slight, serious, fatal).
- `Latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the accident location.
- `Light_Conditions`: Lighting conditions at the time of the accident.
- `Number_of_Casualties`: Number of casualties in the accident.
- `Number_of_Vehicles`: Number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- `Road_Surface_Conditions`: Condition of the road surface (e.g., dry, wet).
- `Road_Type`: Type of road where the accident occurred.
- `Time`: Time of the accident.
- `Urban_or_Rural_Area`: Whether the accident occurred in an urban or rural area.
- `Weather_Conditions`: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- `Vehicle_Type`: Type of vehicles involved in the accident.

## How to Use
1. **Download the dataset**: [Road_Accident_Data.xlsx](Road_Accident_Data.xlsx)
2. **Open the file** in Microsoft Excel or any compatible spreadsheet software.
3. **Explore the data**: Use the built-in Excel tools to filter, sort, and analyze the data.
4. **Visualize the data**: Create charts and graphs to identify patterns and trends.

## Analysis and Findings
The project includes an analysis of the following aspects:
- **Accident Frequency**: Analysis of accidents by day of the week and time of day.
- **Severity Analysis**: Comparison of accident severity across different conditions.
- **Environmental Factors**: Impact of weather and light conditions on accident rates.
- **Location Analysis**: Identification of high-risk locations based on accident density.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to road accidents. These insights can be used by policymakers and road safety authorities to implement measures that improve road safety.
